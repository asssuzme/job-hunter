# Authentication Solution - Popup-Based Login

## The Issue Resolved
Supabase was redirecting to `localhost:3000` causing authentication failures. This has been fixed using a popup-based authentication approach.

## How It Works Now

### New Authentication Flow:
1. **Click "Sign in with Google"** - Opens authentication in a popup window
2. **Complete Google login** - In the popup window
3. **Automatic sync** - App detects successful login and syncs with backend
4. **No redirects needed** - Bypasses Supabase's redirect configuration entirely

## Benefits of This Approach:
- ✅ No redirect URL configuration needed
- ✅ Works on any domain (localhost, production, etc.)
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Avoids the localhost:3000 redirect issue completely

## Testing the New Flow:

1. **Clear your browser cache** (important!)
2. **Go to your app** (http://localhost:5000 or production URL)
3. **Click "Sign in with Google"**
4. **Complete login in the popup**
5. **App will automatically refresh after successful login**

## Troubleshooting:

### If popup is blocked:
- Allow popups for your domain
- Check browser popup blocker settings

### If authentication fails:
- Make sure cookies are enabled
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Check browser console for errors

## Technical Details:
- Uses `skipBrowserRedirect: true` to prevent redirects
- Opens OAuth in popup window
- Listens for authentication state changes
- Syncs with backend after successful auth
- No manual URL configuration needed in Supabase dashboard
