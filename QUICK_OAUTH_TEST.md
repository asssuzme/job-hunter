# Quick OAuth Production Test

Since redirect URIs are already added, let's identify the exact issue:

## Step 1: Check Current Configuration
Visit: https://gigfloww.com/api/oauth-debug

This will show:
- Exact Client ID being used
- Whether Client Secret is present
- Current callback URL configuration

## Step 2: Common Issues to Check

### Issue A: Wrong Google Cloud Project
- You might have multiple Google Cloud projects
- The Client ID/Secret might be from a different project
- **Solution**: Double-check which project contains your OAuth app

### Issue B: OAuth App in Testing Mode
- If your OAuth app is in "Testing" mode, it only works for test users
- **Solution**: Go to OAuth consent screen â†’ Publish your app

### Issue C: APIs Not Enabled
- **Gmail API** might not be enabled for sending emails
- **Google+ API** might not be enabled for profile access
- **Solution**: Enable both APIs in Google Cloud Console

### Issue D: Client Secret Mismatch
- The GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable might be wrong
- **Solution**: Copy the correct secret from Google Cloud Console

## Step 3: Quick Test
1. Check the diagnostic endpoint: https://gigfloww.com/api/oauth-debug
2. Compare the Client ID shown with your Google Cloud Console
3. If they match, try publishing your OAuth app (if in testing mode)
4. If they don't match, update your environment variables

## Step 4: Alternative Solution
If OAuth continues to fail, users can still send emails using:
- **"Use Email App"** button (opens default email client)
- Manual copy-paste of generated email content
